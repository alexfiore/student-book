  adjectives: "fun, balanced, curious"
  favourite_movie: "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"
  favourite_person: "Normally, I might pick a historical figure like Augustus Ceasar, but when I saw this question I immediately thought about my grandfather on my dad's side who I never got to meet.  I hear he was an adventurous, fun, and playful person.  So, I think having dinner with him would be a pretty fun experience."
  skill: "Given some of my project management background some things that immediately come to mind are pairwise comparison as a means to prioritize feature sets, or project estimation as a means to determine difficulty, duration, etc."
  surprise: "Though I don't have any ethnic ties to Eastern Europe, I've lived in Russia and Romania for a total of about 5 years.  Both experiences shared a number of similarities and at the same time were dramatically different.  I'd be happy to speak with classmates about both."
