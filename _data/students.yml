He was the president of the United States during post-World-War-II and oversaw many modern changes that we rely on today, such as NASA and the highway system.

All too often, I hear about how great America was, and how it isn’t any more, but I can’t help but feel like the older generation might just be blinded by nostalgia. Talking to Eisenhower might help me better realize if my theory is correct or not."
