          <p><strong>If you could have dinner with one person, dead or alive, who would it be and why?</strong></p>
          <p>Normally, I might pick a historical figure like Augustus Ceasar, but when I saw this question I immediately thought about my grandfather on my dad's side who I never got to meet.  I hear he was an adventurous, fun, and playful person.  So, I think having dinner with him would be a pretty fun experience.</p>

          <p><strong>What's one skill that you could teach everyone else in class?</strong></p>
          <p>Given some of my project management background some things that immediately come to mind are pairwise comparison as a means to prioritize feature sets, or project estimation as a means to determine difficulty, duration, etc.</p>
        </div>

          <p><strong>What is the one thing about you that people would be surprised to learn?</strong></p>
          <p>Though I don't have any ethnic ties to Eastern Europe, I've lived in Russia and Romania for a total of about 5 years.  Both experiences shared a number of similarities and at the same time were dramatically different.  I'd be happy to speak with classmates about both.</p>

          <p><strong>If you could have dinner with one person, dead or alive, who would it be and why?</strong></p>
          <p>I would choose Joe Rogan. First off, who wouldn't want to sit down with a comedian and self-made entrepreneur? Second, his podcast 'The Joe Rogan Experience' is one of the most successful podcasts on the internet. This allows him to speak to some pretty interesting people, and picking his brain and conversing with him would be great.</p>

          <p><strong>If you could have dinner with one person, dead or alive, who would it be and why?</strong></p>
          <p>I would much prefer to have dinner with someone who is living.  This is due mostly to my appreciation for sharing interesting conversation.  Although I have never had the opportunity to dine with the deceased, I would assume it may be less enjoyable than having dinner with someone who is alive. So, if I were to choose to invite a living person to dinner, I think it would have to be Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche.  Chogyam Ringpoche is someone who introduced elements of Budhism to the West in the 1960's.  His teachings are based on a vision, which sees enlightened society as not purely mythical, but as realizable by people of all faiths through practices of mindfulness/awareness, non-aggression, and sacred outlook.  To me, these concepts are at the same time, both simple and extremely complex. I'm left with a million questions about life and our place in the world.  All questions I would LOVE to ask over dinner!</p>

          <p>Joseph Campbell. As someone embarking on a journey that will ideally alter my path for the better, I would love to learn and receive guidance from a man that examined who we are at our core and why we seek what we seek. I believe that many (if not all) of us in this program are here because it is the next step in discovering our own path, and I am certainly no different.</p>

          <p>I'd like to have dinner with Winston Churchill. He was an incredibly smart man and a great leader, and I've read that he was quite the jokester as well. We'd have a good dinner, probably some delicious steaks, medium rare, and we'd dine at Buckingham Palace. Afterwards, we'd smoke a cigar and drink whiskey, while discussing the politics of Nazi Germany and WW2 wartime strategies.</p>

          <p>I would have to choose Hernan Cortes. I read a biography of Cortes and was blown away by his story - he led a small group of Spaniards deep into Mexico to topple the Aztec empire and capture their capital city, which was the largest city in the world at the time. The man was certainly flawed and committed some terrible atrocities, but his sheer audacity, determination and fanatical religious devotion were astounding. It's hard to admire a man like that, but I can't think of a person who would provide more interesting dinner conversation than Cortes.</p>

          <p><strong>If you could have dinner with one person, dead or alive, who would it be and why?</strong></p>
          <p>I have been really deep into an Ancestry.com hole as of late and would love to meet my great grandfather from Ireland. I would ask him about life in America back then and definitely get some pictures of the family.</p>

        <div>
          <p><strong>What's one skill that you could teach everyone else in class?</strong></p>
          <p>Installing an aftermarket stereo in your car. Or, something that can be done inside: a great card trick that ends in me slapping cards out of your hand and leaving the card you picked.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p><strong>What is the one thing about you that people would be surprised to learn?</strong></p>
          <p>I am the lead singer in a band that has been playing in the Boston area over the last 10 years ... and I am huge fan of karaoke outings.</p>

          <p>Elizabeth Warren:  She is both brilliant and compassionate, a rare combination for a person with power.  She has the mental ability to understand complex problems, come up with reasonable solutions, and has the clout to get them implemented.  Furthermore, she seems very approachable which is important for a shy-ish person like myself.</p>

          <p><strong>What is the one thing about you that people would be surprised to learn?</strong></p>
          <p>Despite being clumsy and artistically-challenged, I'm quite crafty.  My kids and I have made over 50 duct tape wallets and have knit dozens of hats/scarves/slippers.  We make origami Christmas tree ornaments and Halloween costumes every year. Just don't ask me to draw.</p>
